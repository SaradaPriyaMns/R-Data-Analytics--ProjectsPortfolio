# R-Data-Analytics--ProjectsPortfolio
A collection of R data analytics projects demonstrating skills in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling

### Author: Naga Sai Sarada Priya Mandala

## Overview

Welcome to my R Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of R programming projects where I applied data analysis, visualization, and statistical techniques to solve complex problems. The portfolio includes projects that involve data manipulation, data visualization with `ggplot2`, statistical modeling, and handling real-world datasets such as the NYC Taxi Trip dataset. 

Although the source code for these projects is kept private due to confidentiality reasons, this repository includes detailed descriptions, project highlights, the tools and programs used, and example outputs. If you're interested in viewing the code or discussing my work, please feel free to contact me.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
- Data analysis and visualization using R
- Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
- Data manipulation using `dplyr` and `tidyverse`
- Creating detailed plots with `ggplot2`
- Handling and cleaning real-world datasets
- Automated data processing pipelines

## Technologies, Programs, and Tools Used:
- **R**: Core programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **R Libraries/Packages**:
  - `dplyr`: For data manipulation and wrangling.
  - `ggplot2`: For creating comprehensive data visualizations.
  - `lubridate`: For working with date and time data.
  - `tidyverse`: For data processing and analysis.
  - `summary()`, `str()`, and other base R functions for data inspection and analysis.
- **Data Sources**: Real-world datasets including NYC Taxi Trip dataset, `msleep` dataset, and the `mtcars` dataset.
- **Markdown and RMarkdown**: For combining code, output, and narratives into documents.

## Projects Included

### 1. Dataframe and Data Selection Operations
- **Description**: This project demonstrates how to create, manipulate, and retrieve specific rows and columns from data frames. Operations include filtering and selecting specific rows and columns, and performing data inspections on well-known datasets like `mtcars`.
- **Technologies Used**: R, `dplyr`, `mtcars` dataset.
- **Skills Applied**: Data frame creation and manipulation, selection of data, basic data inspection.

### 2. Data Analysis on `msleep` Dataset
- **Description**: This project analyzes the `msleep` dataset, exploring the relationship between different variables like body weight, brain weight, and sleep patterns across various animal species. The analysis includes summary statistics, visualization, and computation of correlation coefficients.
- **Technologies Used**: R, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `msleep` dataset.
- **Skills Applied**: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization using scatter plots and linear regression lines, correlation analysis.

### 3. NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing and cleaning the NYC Green Taxi Trip dataset. The focus is on detecting data anomalies, handling missing values, creating visualizations of trip distances, and outlier detection.
- **Technologies Used**: R, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, NYC Green Taxi Trip dataset.
- **Skills Applied**: Data cleaning, outlier detection, handling missing values, data visualization using histograms and boxplots.

### 4. Taxi Trip Data Inspection and Visualization
- **Description**: This project further explores the NYC Green Taxi Trip dataset, focusing on data inspection, conversion of variables to factors, and analyzing trip types and payment methods. The project also includes visualizing the frequency of daily pickups and the median trip distances by the hour of the day.
- **Technologies Used**: R, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, NYC Green Taxi Trip dataset.
- **Skills Applied**: Data inspection, factor conversion, frequency analysis, visualization using bar charts and line plots.
